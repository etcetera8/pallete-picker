[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/etcetera8/pallete-picker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/etcetera8/pallete-picker)

This is a project using a Node/Express backend to serve static files to a jQuery front-end in order for users to generate random color palletes, save them, and come back to modify them.
